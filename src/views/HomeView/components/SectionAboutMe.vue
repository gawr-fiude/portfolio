        I was born in

        transportation and

          ><em>Petit Pave</em></a

        and found comfort on books and cartoons. Overall I'd say I'm very
        approcheable person, even though being an introvert, that loves to learn
        and teach.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>

      <p>
        Movies and Cartoons have always been some of my favorite ways of
        spending my free time.

        will always have a special place in my heart.

        Gaming is another big one. I don't play competitive games, I'd rather
        have a group of 3-4 friends playing a cooperative game, such as
        <a

          >Trine 5</a

        my favorites are

        Baking is the hobby I have that makes me famous with some demographics
        (people who like little treats). I love baking, but most recipes yield
        quantities not at all recommended to be eaten by a single person. Hence,
        I usually bring treats to work, or weekend events. My favorite recipes
        include

        and

        Not sure if I should include programming as a Hobby. Choose a job you
        love or something... forgot what the full quote is.

      <h3>Technology</h3>

      <p>
        Can't say I had a particular interest for technology from a young age,
        but I have recently found it as a medium to both express myself and
        create tools to help others on their daily tasks. That and doodling on
        vector art software... much fun.

        I'm a Linux user at home. Not a diehard Linux user, no, I run
        <a

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Linux Mint</a
        >
        on my personal computer. I find amusing the idea of
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >open source</a
        >
        community-driven systems and projects. I love the ability to customize a
        lot of the software I interact with. I think that's something that
        helped stir my current interest on working with interfaces.

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>

      <p>
        After working a bit with frontend technologies, I started being way way
        more aware of
        <a
          href="https://www.a11yproject.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >accessibility</a
        >, both on digital interfaces as well as physical ones (from the section
        on the pavement meant for blind people to the Skip to Content links on
        websites). Trying to see the world as if you were somebody else is a
        interesting way of learning new things. If you have the time to do so,
        try navigating this page using only your keyboard. Did you even know you
        can do that? Try pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
        <kbd>Tab</kbd> a bit.
