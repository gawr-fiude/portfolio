            I suppose there’ll never be a time I look back and think I should
            have picked any other graduation. College was my first experience
            with actually looking into the foundation of the technologies I have
            been used to since an early age. There's nothing alike the rewarding
            feeling of understanding a new concept, solving a new problem.

            In college, I learned how to utilize many of the most common
            programming languages, such as Python, Java and C++, but also some
            of the more specialized ones, like Prolog.

            My course conclusion paper was an exploratory research on the
            viability of utilizing GPUs to optimize a C++ stream processing
            framework.

          <p>
            Being born in a non-English-speaking country, I have always been
            stimulated to learn English. I had classes in school, but, to
            improve myself, I took many years of an actual English language
            course, so much so that after concluding it, I was to receive a
            travel prize from the school for my TOEFL performance, which was
            canceled because of COVID.
