          <p>
            As a trainee, I worked as a Full Stack Web Developer on a team
            dedicated to Database Management Automation. The team's main product
            is a portal offering different resources and applications to DBAs,
            such as Health Check and Server Mapping.
          </p>

          <p>
            Managed a few internal Packages for Web Development, most notably a
            <a

            >
            Component Library based on the company's Design System and a helper
            for the Sharepoint API, which wasn't used much by the team I was in,
            but is something that helps a lot of smaller projects (especially
            those from organizations that lack the development experience).
          </p>

          <p>
            I was also part of different initiatives inside the company, helping
            internal committees with their email communications and web
            development, both as a developer and consultant.
